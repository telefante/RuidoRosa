Analogy, emulation
similarities at a distance
how do I assemble 
with the non-
sense ?
navigating the noise
pearl
pearl in 
pearl in noise 
the folds of the landscape
are singing those
functions of the unknown
show their apparent disorder
I am attracted to that space
that produces ghosts
creates memories
speculative
simulation
and
attraction
mysticism
and attraction
the unknown
and attraction
contemplate
and
emigrate
and simulate
